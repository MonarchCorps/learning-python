print(f'\nYour story is: \n The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very {adjective} {animal} {verb_one} down the hallway. "{exclamation.capitalize()}!" I yelled. But all I could think to do was to {verb_two} over and over. Miraculously, that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb_three} right in front of my family.')
